# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
This project explores credit card transaction data to detect fraud patterns. 
It includes feature engineering, simple rules, and false positive reduction.

## Dataset
- Public credit card dataset (link to Kaggle)
- CSV file not included due to size

## Steps Performed
1. Data exploration
2. Feature engineering
3. Fraud pattern detection
4. False positive reduction logic
5. Visualization and conclusions

## Findings
- Fraud transactions are rare (<1%)
- High amount transactions are more likely to be fraud
- Combining features reduces false positives
- Visualizations clearly show patterns

## How to Run
- Open the notebook `notebooks/01_exploration.ipynb` in Jupyter
- Download the CSV from Kaggle and place it in `data/` folder
- Run each cell step by step
